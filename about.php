      <h2>My Teaching CV</h2>
      <p>I am a business, technology, and design teacher at Glenbrook South High School.</p>
      <p>Instructionally, my areas of focus include teaching entrepreneurship, graphic design, web design, and video game design. I feel incredibly fortunate to get to teach what I&rsquo;m most passionate about to some of the most amazing students around.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was employed as a district level technology coach in Lake Villa School District 41, where I worked with teachers to integrate technology into their lessons.</p>
      <p>Prior to that, I worked in a charter school on Chicago&rsquo;s Northwest Side. There, I developed and refined a comprehensive technology curriculum that focused on 21st century literacy, which I have learned to define as &ldquo;fluency in all forms of communication.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>I earned my masters in Educational Leadership from Northeastern Illinois University. I earned a degree in History Education from Illinois State University. I hold Type 9 teaching and Type 75 administrative certificates. I also attended Oakton Community College, Northern Michigan University, and Governors State University, where I completed the requirements to earn Technology Education and Business, Marketing, and Computer Education teaching endorsements.</p>
      <p>In addition to teaching, I lead professional development in the areas of educational technology and speak on matters related to business education.</p>
